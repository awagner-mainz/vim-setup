<h1>Inserting references in emails with VIM</h1>

<h2>Why use references to URIs?</h2>

<p>Inline URIs in emails make the text around them obscure. This is
why I recommend using <a href="../../../2000/03/email#uri">references
to URIs</a>.</p>

<p>For example, I find the following:</p>
<pre>You will find information about our company at &lt;http://www.example.com/&gt;
and our products are at
&lt;http://www.example.com/products/this_is_a_very_long_uri_isnt_it?&gt;.
Have a good day!

<h2>The drawback of using references</h2>

<p>However, writing emails with references is sometimes a pain because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You have to keep track of the numbering.</li>
  <li>You need to go at the end of the email, put the reference, and then go
    back to where you were editing the email.</li>
</ul>

<p>I write my emails with <a href="http://www.vim.org/">VIM</a> because it is
powerful and fast, and yet pretty light. The only thing that I needed to be
completely happy was an easy way to add references, so I wrote a few functions
and macros to do the job.</p>

<h2>What do the functions and macros do?</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.vim.org/">VIM</a> code I wrote does the
following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It scans the email being edited to find any existing reference and so
    that the numbering does not clash, in case you are replying to
  somebody.</li>
  <li>It allows the user to insert a referent while in insert mode, with a
    single keystroke.</li>
  <li>It allows the user to convert inline URIs into references.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Download the code</h2>

<p>Download the <a href="uri-ref-20010910.vim">September 10, 2001
version</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="uri-ref-20010223.vim">February 23, 2001
version</a> had different behaviors for the insert reference function
and the conversion error, which has been fixed.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>The current key mapping does the following:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><kbd>&lt;F5&gt;</kbd></dt>
    <dd>Insert a reference at the cursor position in insert mode.</dd>
  <dt><kbd>&lt;F6&gt;</kbd></dt>
    <dd>Convert a URI of the form <samp>&lt;http://www.example.com/&gt;</samp>
      to a reference.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Note that the mode only works on an email which has headers and a
signature. In <a href="http://www.mutt.org/">Mutt</a>, you need to set the
following option: <code>set edit_headers</code>.</p>

<h3>Inserting a reference at the cursor position</h3>

<p>While in insert mode, press <kbd>&lt;F5&gt;</kbd> and enter the URI of the
reference you want to include at the prompt:</p>
